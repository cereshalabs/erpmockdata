# erpmockdata – Simulated ERP Data Generator for Prototyping

**Version 1.0**

This tool helps consultants and data engineers quickly prototype manufacturing ERP pipelines without relying on real customer data.

It can generate realistic data tables that are common in a production ERP system — such as product specs, assembly stations, operators, and order history — using Python and the Faker library.

## 📌 Why This Exists

As a data engineering consultant, I often need to build out pipeline demos, test ETL frameworks, or validate transformations — **before any production access is granted**.

Rather than waiting on customer data or mocking it manually, this tool generates clean, referentially consistent datasets in seconds.
